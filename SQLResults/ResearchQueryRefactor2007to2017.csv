"25424074","refactor large AngularJS module config into separate files","15","### Problem: Large `config()` ###

The config of my AngularJS app is growing quite large. How would you refactor the following into separate files?

    // app.js
    angular.module('myApp')
        .config(function($urlRouterProvider, $stateProvider, $httpProvider) {
            // Configure routing (uiRouter)
            $urlRouterProvider.when('/site', '/site/welcome');
            $stateProvider.state('main', ...
            ...

            // Configure http interceptors
            $httpProvider.interceptors.push(function () {              
                ...
            });
        });


----------


### Option 1. Multiple `config()`s ###

I know that I can have multiple `config()`s and place them in separate files like this:

    // app.js
    angular.module('myApp');

    // routerConfiguration.js
    angular.module('myApp')
        .config(function($urlRouterProvider, $stateProvider) {
            // Configure routing (uiRouter)
            $urlRouterProvider.when('/site', '/site/welcome');
            $stateProvider.state('main', ...
            ...

    // httpInterceptorConfig.js
    angular.module('myApp')
        .config(function($httpProvider) {
            // Configure http interceptors
            $httpProvider.interceptors.push(function () {              
                ...
            });
        });

What I do not like about this, is that in the original app.js, **there is no way of getting an overview** of what is run at startup. 


----------


### Option 2. Inject something ###

I would prefer to do something like this, because it would be easier to see what is configured, directly in the app.js. However I know that this is not possible, since we cannot inject services into `config()`. 

**Can I use providers to solve this? Is there a better way?**

    // app.js
    angular.module('myApp')
        .config(function(routerConfig, httpInterceptorConfig) {
            routerConfig.setup();
            httpInterceptorConfig.setup();
        });

    // routerConfig.js
    angular.module('myApp')
        .factory('routerConfig', function($urlRouterProvider, $stateProvider) {
            return {
                setup: function() {
                    // Configure routing (uiRouter)
                    $urlRouterProvider.when('/site', '/site/welcome');
                    $stateProvider.state('main', ...
                    ...
                }
            };
        });
    });

    // httpInterceptorConfig.js
    angular.module('myApp')
        .factory('httpInterceptorConfig', function($httpProvider) {
            return {
                setup: function() {
                    // Configure http interceptors
                    $httpProvider.interceptors.push(function () {              
                    ...
                }
            };
        });

at this point, i've decided to try refactoring in xcode and an error occurs.
it comes from one of my original source code. 

i have a property of (nonatomic, weak) and i've synthesized it ==> synthesize of 'weak' property is only allowed in ARC or GC mode. 

I am puzzeled - i am using arc and it complains that it is only allowed in arc??

At the moment, i've refactored the thirdparty app from other project and copied it for my project to work, but the above is a question I'd still like to understand why .
Thanks!

Basically, all of these cursors (there's more than 3) are the same summary/reporting queries. The difference is in the factored subqueries. There are always 2 factored subqueries, ""X"" and ""Y"", and they always select the same columns to feed into the main reporting query.

The problem is that the main reporting query is VERY large, about 70 lines. This itself isn't so bad, but it was copy-pasted for ALL of the reporting queries (I think there's over a dozen).

Since the only difference is in the factored subqueries (and they all return the same columns, it's really just a difference in the tables they select from and their conditions) I was hoping to find a way to refactor all this so that there is ONE query for the giant report and smaller ones for the various factored subqueries so that when changes are made to the way the report is done, I only have to do it in one place, not a dozen. Not to mention a much easier-to-navigate (and read) file!

I just don't know how to properly refactor something like this. I was thinking pipelined functions? I'm not sure they're appropriate for this though, or if there's a simpler way...

On the other hand, I also wonder if performance would be significantly worse by splitting out the reporting query. Performance (speed) *is* an issue for this system. I'd rather not introduce changes for developer convenience if it adds significant execution time.

 - Array-bound checking. Is this treated differently in double[] and List<Double> and does it matter? I expect some problems to violate bounds as the algorithm is fairly simple and has only been applied to a few data sets.

 - If I don't refactor then the code has an ugly and possibly fragile intermixture of the two approaches. I am already trying to write things such as:

    List&lt;double[]&gt; and

**SUMMARY** The consensus so far:

 - Collections have a significant performance hit over primitive arrays, especially for constructs such as matrices. This is incurred in auto(un)boxing numerics and in accessing list items

 - For tight numerical (scientific) algorithms the array notation [][] is actually easier to read but the variables should named as helpfully as possible

 - Generics and arrays do not mix well. It may be useful to wrap the arrays in classes to transport them in/out of the tight algorithm.

There is little objective reason to make the change

**QUESTION** @SeanOwen has suggested that it would be useful to take constant values out of the loops. Assuming I haven't goofed this would look like:


     int len1 = len[1];
     int len0 = len[0];
     int seq1 = seq[1];
     int[] pointersi;
     double[] matrixi;
     for (int i = 1; i < len0+1; i++) {
         matrixi = matrix[i];
         pointersi = pointers[i];
     }
     for (int j = 1; j < len1+1; j++) {
        int jj = (cont == BY_TYPE) ? seq1[j-1] : j-1;
        for (int i = 1; i < len0+1; i++) {
            matrixi[j] = matrixi[j] + gap;
            double m = matrixi[j-1] + gap;
            if (m > matrixi[j]) {

            }

I'd like to know your opinion about using the fluent interface pattern to refactor a long method.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface


The fluent pattern is not included in the refactoring books.


for example, say you have this long method (with a long name as it 
does many things)

    class TravelClub {
    
       Receipt buyAndAddPointsAndGetReceipt(long amount, long cardNumber) {
    	buy(amount);
    	accumulatePoints(cardNumber);
    	return generateReceipt();
    	
       }
    
       void buy(int amount) {...}
    
       void accumlatePoints(int cardNumber) {...}
    
       void generateRecepit() {...}
    
    }

called as:

    Receipt myReceipt = myTravelClub.buyAndAddPointsAndGetReceipt(543L,12345678L);


That could be refactored to:

    class TravelClub {
    
       TravelClub buy(long amount) {
    	buy(amount);
    	return this;
       }
    
       TravelClub accumulatePoints(long cardNumber) {
    	buy(amount);
    	return this;
       }
    
       Receipt generateReceipt() {
    	return new Receipt(...);
       }
    
    
    }

and called as:

    Receipt myReceipt = myTravelClub.buy(543L).accumulatePoints(12345678L).generateReceipt();



from my point of view this is a quite good manner to decompose a long method and
also to decompose its name.



what do you think?

"7707673","refactoring javascript. decouple markup or separate modules","3","I'm trying to make a large (~10K lines) javascript code base more maintainable.  Pretty much all of the code is contained in one massive class.  I want to do some refactoring, but I don't want to completely rewrite the code.  

I have two ideas for how to re-organize the code, but I'm not sure which one is best. (I'm very open to other ideas too)  What do you think about each of these approaches?  How would you decide which is best?


Idea 1 – Decouple markup from business logic.
We have a somewhat complicated set of rules for what and how things should be displayed to users.  This approach would split that into ""What do we display?"" and ""How do we display it?""


Idea 2 – Break apart separate components into their own class. 
There are several somewhat disjoint components in this code.  If this code base were Facebook's – this approach would involve pulling apart the code for photos and the newsfeed.

...this is a minimal version. In practice, there are numerous items in ""tasks"", ""milestones"" and ""connections"". 

I need to iterate through the object and determine the ""id"" of the ""milestones"" item with the lowest/earliest ""milestoneDate"", then identify the ""connections"" item that has the same value for its ""pageSourceId"" and return its ""pageTargetId"".

So in the above example:

Step 1)  Iterate through the object and determine the ""id"" of the ""milestones"" item with the lowest/earliest ""milestoneDate"".

`Answer: milestones.id = ""task_1""`

Step 2) Identify the ""connections"" item that has the same value for its ""pageSourceId"".

`Answer: connections.pageSourceId = ""task_1""`

Step 3) Return its ""pageTargetId"".

`Answer: ""task_3""`

I have a working example [here][1]. However, I would like to know if there is a way to accomplish this without using the extremely high start date and also in one loop.

        <blogger>jeff</blogger>
        <blogger>joel</blogger>
    </site>

It works, but the `addDict` function looks a little too repetitive. I'm sure there's a way to refactor it into 3 co-recursive functions named `addDict`, `addList` and `addElse`, but my brain is stuck. Any help?

Also, any way to get rid of the `offset +` thing in every line would be nice.

It works, but the `addDict` function looks a little too repetitive. I'm sure there's a way to refactor it into 3 co-recursive functions named `addDict`, `addList` and `addElse`, but my brain is stuck. Any help?

I'm using the -fno-objc-arc flags on all the relevant files, so it's compiling, but the project uses #ifndef __OBJC_GC_ blocks to release memory, which is causing memory allocation errors. I'm trying to determine the right solution, and so far I have the following:

1.) find a different library or write my own - this is the only free library of it's kind, so this is obviously not ideal, and I'm new enough that I don't feel comfortable tackling that

2.) remove the #ifndef blocks and cross my fingers - not able to work on the project today, but that's my next plan

3.) refactor the code to be ARC compliant and remove the -fno-objc-arc flags

is #2 likely to work? How hard would #3 be, andwould it actually cause the compiler to define __OBJC_GC_? (there's about 4-5 classes that I'm planning on using, but they're pretty sizeable)

You can see from the title of the method that I started with good intentions of ""building the ball"".

There are a few issues I ran up against:

The problem is that then I needed to move the ball, so I created that while loop.  I don't see any other way to do that other than just keep it ""true"", so that means any other code I create below this loop won't happen.  I didn't make the while loop a different function because I was using those variables `i and j`.

So I don't see how I can refactor beyond this loop.  

So my main question is:

How would I pass the values of `i and j` to a new method: ""animateBall"" and how would I use 
`ball.move(vx + vx, vy + vy);` in that new method if ball has been declared in the buildBall method?

I understand this is probably a simple thing of better understanding variable scope and passing arguments, but I'm not quite there yet...

"7525594","refactoring: swicthing from custom data access layer to Entity Framework","2","I am a .NET Developer and as part of a refactoring project, I have a few questions.

Our software is currently using an Active Record pattern (one to one mapping between the data objects and the business objects). The bad thing is that the business objects inherits from the data objects, inducing highly couple between the layers.

Our goal is to switch from our custom data access layer (based on ADO.NET) to Entity Framework. The constraint we have is not to break the code so that our older applications will still compile and run using the old data access layer while allowing us to use EF for the new projects.

My first idea to do so is to break the inheritance and have the data object as an attribute of the business object (and use an interface or abstract class in order to inject the data object, whether it is our custom layer or Entity Framework). The properties would be migrated from the Data objects to the business objects which would act like some kind of ""proxy"" to access the properties of the data objects.
 
Would that be a viable solution ? That would still use the active record pattern (and I don't like this a lot, since our business layer has become quite large) so if you have any other idea, please don't hesitate.

My other question is about the Entity framework generation. We need the entities properties to have the same name as the old data objects (we would use an abstract class in order to allow the business objects to call the properties of the data object, whether it is our custom data object or the EF entities). What would be the best way to accomplish that ? Using T4 to generate the entities or have an EF Code first approach ?

I am very open to any suggestion, so please do not hesitate to propose other approaches. Thanks for your time.","2011-09-23 07:22:58"

is there a way to use this code in multiple models without having this enormous duplication?

i'm thankful for every hint!
especially i find it hard to deal with the `do |format|` block. but also i'm not sure where to put the code and how to use it with different types of models.

"41528654","refactor filtering and search result","2","I am developing an app which is somewhat similar to airbnb. There are two search function, one for searching apartment and other for searching car rental. When searching apartment, the result page shows the searched result along with some filtering options like filter from range of price and filter from various options like amenities, services. The result page of car rental is same as apartment result page. I mean car result shows the searched result regarding car that are available as rent and filtering categories.

Here is my reducer and actions for such feature. This is a working code. I am trying to code it in best way as much as i can to train my coding skill. I want help of other expert programmers on how can i refactor this code to much better?

What I'd like to achieve:

- Allow the code to follow the open/closed principle as there will be more groups / levels in time. 
- Remove the duplication in the 'level' switch statement. 
- Ideally remove the 'group' top level switch statement.

"37263329","refactoring multi-dimensional if/else conditions","1","I'm writing in Swift, but the question is really language agnostic.

I have two variables, each of which could have multiple - but discrete - values. The various combinations of the two values lead to different behavior. 

I need to consider all combinations and execute the appropriate code. What's the cleanest/easiest-to-maintain way to do this?

Graphically, it would look like this:

    var2 / var1 |    A    |    B    |    C    |
    ------------|---------|---------|---------|
    Z           |(A && Z) |(B && Z) |(C && Z) |
    ------------|---------|---------|---------|
    Y           |(A && Y) |(B && Y) |(C && Y) |
    ------------|---------|---------|---------|
    X           |(A && X) |(B && X) |(C && X) |
    -------------------------------------------

You could imagine, with a third variable, the matrix becomes 3-dimensional, etc. which is why I'm interested in a generalizable solution, not necessarily a specific solution for my particular project.

I could go multiple if/else:

    if (var1 == A && var2 == Z) {}
    else if (var1 == B && var2 == Z) {}
    else if ...

But that sounds awful.

Currently, I'm using one if/else and the same switch over and over:

    if var1 == A {
        switch var2 {
            case Z:
            case Y:
            case X:
        }
    } else if var1 == B {
        switch var2 {
            case Z:
            case Y:
            case X:
        }
    } ...

But reusing the same switch tells me I'm doing it wrong.

Is this a case for polymorphism? That concept is a bit nebulous to me, and I don't quite philosophically get it. Is there a better way?

My real-life example is a calculator-type app where behavior depends not only on the button pressed, but also the *previous* button pressed, i.e. pressing '=' after a '#' is different than pressing '=' after '+' is different than pressing '+' after '=' is different than pressing a '#' after a '#', etc... So I'm comparing the current button pressed to the previous button pressed to determine the behavior of the calculator.","2016-05-16 21:12:39"

"2615901","refactor LINQ TO SQL custom properties that instantiate datacontext","1","I am working on an existing ASP.NET MVC app that started small and has grown with time to require a good re-architecture and refactoring.

One thing that I am struggling with is that we've got partial classes of the L2S entities so we could add some extra properties, but these props create a new data context and query the DB for a subset of data.  This would be the equivalent to doing the following in SQL, which is not a very good way to write this query as oppsed to joins: 

    SELECT tbl1.stuff, 
        (SELECT nestedValue FROM tbl2 WHERE tbl2.Foo = tbl1.Bar),
        tbl1.moreStuff
     FROM tbl1

so in short here's what we've got in some of our partial entity classes:

    public partial class Ticket {
    
    public StatusUpdate LastStatusUpdate
    {
        get
        {

One thing that I am struggling with is that we've got partial classes of the L2S entities so we could add some extra properties, but these props create a new data context and query the DB for a subset of data.  This would be the equivalent to doing the following in SQL, which is not a very good way to write this query as oppsed to joins: 

    SELECT tbl1.stuff, 
        (SELECT nestedValue FROM tbl2 WHERE tbl2.Foo = tbl1.Bar),
        tbl1.moreStuff
     FROM tbl1

so in short here's what we've got in some of our partial entity classes:

    public partial class Ticket {
    
    public StatusUpdate LastStatusUpdate
    {
        get
        {
             //this static method call returns a new DataContext but needs to be refactored

EDIT:  I am adding the code for the DataContextFactory that we created during our refactoring efforts.  Note that in the code above we have a GetContext() static method in the Linq DataContext class, which news up a datacontext, and is not using the DataContextFactory below:

    public class DataContextFactory<T> : IDataContextFactory where T : System.Data.Linq.DataContext
    {
    	public DataContextFactory()
    	{
    		_context = Activator.CreateInstance<T>();
    	}
    
    	public DataContextFactory(T context)
    	{
    		_context = context;
    	}
    
    	private System.Data.Linq.DataContext _context;
    	public System.Data.Linq.DataContext Context
    	{
    		get 
    		{
    			return _context; 
    		}

"4776687","refactor a method with a block that contains multiple blocks itself","1","I'm using Ruby 1.9.2

I have a class method called search that takes a block

e.g.

    class MyClass
      def self.search do
        if criteria1
          keywords ""abcde"", fields: :c1 do
            minimum_match(1)

            minimum_match(1)
          end
        end
      end
    end

What I'd like to do is refractor the MyClass.search method and have a simple one-line method for each if/end statement

e.g. it would look something like this:

    class MyClass
    
      def self.search do
        c1_method
        c2_method
      end
    
      def self.c1_method
        if criteria1
          return keywords ""abcde"", fields: :c1 do
            minimum_match(1)
          end
        end

            minimum_match(1)
          end
        end
      end
    end

But the refactoring that I show above doesn't quite work.  It looks like the ""blocks"" that I'm returning in c1_method and c2_method aren't really being returned and evaluated in the search method, but I'm not sure how to do that.

"5679199","refactoring a database and application due to new requirements","1","My application manages customer's complaints **and has already been deployed into production**. Each complaint has a code to identify it (for eaxmple ""late delivery""  ), a ""department"" type (wich is essentially the department responsible for that kind of complaint) and another ""model"" code which identifies the route through department's employees this complaint dossier has to follow (first to hr responsible then to hr big boss finally back to customer care). Each dossier has some common info and can have department specific infos, that's why i need deparment code.
For example Customer care get a complaint about ""rudeness"" of a call center operator, opens a dossier with code ABC and type ""HR"" (there's could be more HR dossier types). When the customer care has filled all the infos, forward it to hr(a mail is sent to the user configured in the system as HR responsible ). The hr employee fills his own section and send it back to customer care.

Till now each complaint code might have only one department and one model, now requirements have changed and i've two problems:

1. Some complaints are identified by the same code but might be due to different departments . For example a complaint about employees rudeness could be sent to the department which rules the call centers or to the department which rules logistics

i could solve this simply extending the table primary key to include the department (hoping they'll not decide the same code for the same department can follow different routes), changing application code might be a bit painful but it can be done : 

Does extending primary keys to composite keys is a problem in Oracle or have side effects on existing records? the actual primary key is not used as foreign key anywere and all fields are filled.


2. this is a quite more difficult problem (at least for me): marketing department (the rulers) wants a special dossier.They monitor time departments take to answer complaints and open a new type of dossier if they exceeds the standard time.
For the above example, if hr always needs the 30% more time to complete employees rudeness dossiers, marketing can open an ""inquire"" dossier about that complaint code directed to hr.  
Now, referring to point 1, i could add a new record for each complaint code having the second part of the key being the marketing code and associating it to a new model.This is going to double the rows of the table (which is already quite large). I see it very error prone for inserting new complaint codes. 

I know it's very hard to give an opinion without being able to see the schema and the code, but i would appreciate your opinion anyway

Class Person in package com.core has a reference to Class Address which is in the same package. I had to move Address to a new package com.core.location. This was simple on the java side, however, there are some quartz triggers which have com.core.Person referencing the old com.core.Address class as part of their job data map. It could be anywhere in the Map.

I have tried a few approaches, like writing an adapter which acts like a common ground between 2 java programs that eventually replace the ols class with the new one. What would be the best way to resolve this?

"15204488","refactor legacy code, extracting small interface from a giant one with a small implementation","1","I have a large piece of code (legacy) which knows to connect to an external service lets say connects to skype and bring its availability, the way its doing this (this is how it works its for the sake of the example). is

    SkypeAvailabilityManager.java
    
    .init
    .start
    .stop
    .connect
    .disconnect
    .keepAlive
    .updateStatus

(lets assume for the example that all methods need to be public and someone calls them).
Now there is a huge piece of code (huge legacy code which calls all above methods).

Now I need to have either synchronizing with skype or with some other service lets say its `MessengerB`

However with messengerB i don't need the init, start, connect, etc, i only need the updateStatus method.

So I thought of this refactor (which does not yet sound fine to me i'll explain why

    Interface: ExternalStatusFetcher

methods of it:

    .updateStatus

Now the legacy code calls the above methods of .init .start .stop .connect in many many places, however the new MessengerStatusUpdaterImpl I need to add only needs .updateStatus and i want to reuse the .updateStatus of the skype implementation because i want to reuse code.

so my limitations:

 1. Reuse SkypeAvailabilityManager.java
 2. Legacy code calls .start .stop ... from many places in code I don't what to change that this is a huge legacy.
 3. I want a common interface meaning in my code I want to treat both impl the same way but so client would either call all the methods or only part of them i do not know until impelemntation is actually initialized with the real implemenation.

what would be a good refactor of it?
If my container class holds an interface that holds all methods this owuld be nice, however my second implemenation does not need all the methods, so i'm a little mixed up what to do.","2013-03-04 15:00:32"

As a first step I removed those methods completely my having them implement a simple interface:

    public interface Command {
	    void execute();
    }

So, its operation method implemented the command interface:

    public class Operation1 implements Command {

        private void doOperation1(){
            switch(CurrentSelection){
                ..all the cases here
            }		
        }
    
        public void execute() {
     		doOperation1();
    	}
    
    }

As I see this, it will buy my a cleaner business logic class, but the trail of the switch cases will remain, right?

"1396166","refactoring and removing case statements when circling over an enum structure","1","An enum structure declared in its own class is a member variable to the business logic class. That enum basically represents the state of that other class.

Although I have revisited the issue several times, replacing, or getting rid of those case statements proves quite frustrating to me.

Several business logic methods simple iterate over the enum and change the state of that class by assigning another value of the same enum, and other properties.

    public enum MyEnum{ A,B,C,D }

The business logic class has this enum as a member:

    public class BusinessLogic {

        private MyEnum CurrentSelection;
        private int propertyX;
        private int propertyY;
    
        public void operation1(){
    		switch(CurrentSelection){
    		case A: {alter propertyX this way; break;}
    		case B: {alter propertyY this way; break;}
    		case C: {alter propertyX that way; break;}
    		case D: {alter propertyY that way; break;}
    		}
    		
    	}
    	
    	public void operation2(){
    		switch(CurrentSelection){
    		case A: {CurrentSelection=MyEnum.B; break;}
    		case B: {CurrentSelection=MyEnum.C; break;}
    		....etc
    		}
    	}
    	
    	public void operation3(){
    		switch(CurrentSelection){
    		case A: {CurrentSelection=MyEnum.D; break;}
    		case B: {CurrentSelection=MyEnum.A; break;}
    		....etc
    		}
    	}
    }


Another client class will instantiate the business logic class, initialing its properties and then using its operation methods.

What I have successfully done (with help from SO) is encapsulate the operation methods into a command pattern structure so I can call the operations without any case statements. ([here][1]).

I guess my trouble is how to encapsulate the case statements in my business logic class. I suspect that I would need polymorphism and the appropriate data structures.

The refactoring experts suggest each case statement should be an implementation of a common interface. But if I have 3 methods iterating over a 4-member enum that means I'd probably need 3 interfaces with 4 implementations each, giving me 12 classes (plus 3 interfaces). Wouldn't that be a class overload? The logic is working fine with those 3 methods as they are, but the issue are the repeating switch/case statements.

Is there a way to refactor those switch statements but avoid a myriad of other classes in the name of polymorphism? Would it be possible to factor out the iterate-over-the-enum part? Or just the cases (where the logic is) should be refactored?

---

As a first step I removed those methods completely my having them implement a simple interface:

    public interface Command {
	    void execute();
    }

So, its operation method implemented the command interface:

    public class Operation1 implements Command {

        private void doOperation1(){
            switch(CurrentSelection){
                ..all the cases here
            }		
        }
    
        public void execute() {
     		doOperation1();
    	}
    
    }

As I see this, it will buy my a cleaner business logic class, but the trail of the switch cases will remain, right?

I only know the exact Model type at runtime of course (Class1...or 4).

I use Entity Framework with such a DbContext:

      public partial class MyDbContext: DbContext
        {
    ...
        
            public virtual DbSet<Class1> Class1{ get; set; }
            public virtual DbSet<Class2> Class2{ get; set; }
            public virtual DbSet<Class3> Class3{ get; set; }
            public virtual DbSet<Class4> Class4{ get; set; }
    ...
        }

I am pretty sure I can end up with a clean code with reflection instead of this horrible thing I wrote. But I did not manage to get anything clean that compiles.

      res.redirect('/page1');
    });
    
    app.get('/page1', function (req, res) {

    const routes = require('./Server/routes')(app);

I have some functions like

and want to have them in separate files too. How can I do this? I am able to export one function but how can I export more than one?

Like

    module.exports = function(){
    
    function sayHello(){

    }
    
    function calc(){
       return 5 + 7;

 1. I cut and paste performCrop() to my util class. 
 2. I had an error at 'startActivityForResult(cropIntent, CROP_IMAGE);' where it didnt recognise the method so i extended the class with 'Extends Activity'

It's really bugging me that I can't figure out how to refactor this code in one if else statement as I'm positive that there is at least one very obvious way to do this.  Any help would be much appreciated!

"35249984","refactoring $rootScope.$apply in Angular","1","my `MusicPlayer.js` Angular service  has a callback function wrapped in `$rootScope.$apply` that updates a specific object (`musicPlayer.currentPlaybackTime`) and is shared to all other controllers ( via applying to `$rootScope`).  

I understand that you'll ideally want to limit any `$rootScope` pollution, so i'm looking at possible refactoring options that take away calling apply methods to `$rootScope` but allows my updated object to be shared across multiple controllers.  

My research indicates that i'll need to register the other controllers (i.e. `PlayerDashboardCtrl.js`, `PlaylistCtrl.js` and `AlbumListCtrl.js`) that  need my `currentPlaybackTime` object, but i'd like to understand what's the most efficient way of doing this.  

Thank you.

                plt.show()
    
       
    

My problem is that i want to plot (ttime,R2) and (ttime,Cc).
But i can't figure how to call R2 and Cc for the 3 different values of D (and dx).

Also, i am taking an error: tuple indices must be integers, not float

at dx[i]=sc.sqrt(D[i]*dt/M).

Thanks!

My controller uses two functions to change a display of ingredients. One tied to a select element for mobile, the other tied to links for desktops.

Is it possible to refactor this to use a service?

My html for Mobile:

    <select ng-model=""ingredient.item"" ng-options=""i.option for i in ingredient.items"" ng-change=""ingredient.change_select(ingredient.item)"">

      describe 'content' do
        # same content as above, but testing content

    end

This works fine and the tests pass - but since there's a lot of repetition here, I wanted to refactor:

    describe 'without' do

      describe 'author' do
        let(:author)  {nil}
        it('fails')   {assert_failure(excerpt} # added a method in this line

      # and the method here
      def assert_failure(instance)
        assert_raises(ArgumentError) { instance }
      end

    end

However this doesn't work - my tests fail with the following error:

    construction::without::author#test_0001_fails:
    ArgumentError: Excerpt cannot be built: Author missing

Which is the error that I would expect to be raised with missing information - and is exactly what I'm testing.  So it seems that when this assertion is extracted, the `ArgumentError` is being raised and stopping the test before `assert_raises` can make any kind of comparison.  I looked into the [code](http://apidock.com/ruby/MiniTest/Assertions/assert_raises) for this assertion, but I can't make out why this would happen when the code is extracted into another method, but not when it's in-line.

Here is the answer that I came up with

              movieLists
       				  .map( movieList => movieList.videos
                      .map(video => video.id)  )   // don't like this part
                      .concatAll()

I am basically nesting a map inside of another map then calling concat all.  

Is it possible to refactor that second map fat arrow so it can sit outside of the first?

"22236651","refactoring similar functions with access to variables","0","I have a simple index page that allows you to click a button to change the colors displayed randomly on the background circle divs. The code I've written is working fine, but its really repetitive; I wrote a function for each button, and the functions look identical except for the variables they access.

I'm trying to refactor this into a single function but can't figure out a way to allow the button that is click to access the correct variable to change the background colors. 
For example here is the function for the first button, which accesses the colorList variable that changes the colors to gray spectrum:

    var colorList1 = [//array of 20 colors]
    var colorList2 = [//array of 20 colors]
    var colorList3 = [//array of 20 colors]
    var colorList4 = [//array of 20 colors]

    // .choice-1 is the div class for the first button
    $("".choice-1"").on(""click"", function() {
        blankSlate();
        colorList = colorList1;
        $(""[id^='nav']"").css(""background-color"", colorList[1]);
        $(""#colorChoice"").css(""background-color"", colorList[1]);
    });

I tried to write something that would access the number in the class name and assign that to a variable that would be accessible to the main function doing something like this:

    var buttonVar = $(""button"").attr[0].nodeValue; // get full name of nodeValue
    var btnChoice = buttonVar[buttonVar.length-1]; // access number at end of class name
    $(""button"").on(""click"",function() {
        $('.choice' + btnChoice).on('click', function(){*/
        blankSlate();
        colorList = colorList + btnChoice;
        $(""[id^='nav']"").css(""background-color"", colorList[btnChoice]);
        $(""#colorChoice"").css(""background-color"", colorList[btnChoice]);
      });

...but I'm not sure that this is the right way to go about it, and I'd love some advice about how this type of refactoring is typically handled. 

Here's a link to a Codepen showing how it works, and with all the html, css and remaining JS viewable.

"35879208","refactor d3 bar chart to be horizontal bar chart","0","I was trying to refactor this bar chart in d3 to be a horizontal bar chart. I think I've isolated the three areas that need to be changed:

the original scale declarations:

      var x0 = d3.scale.ordinal()
          .rangeRoundBands([0, width], 0.1);
    
      var x1 = d3.scale.ordinal();
    
      var y = d3.scale.linear()
          .range([height, 0]);

The domain definitions:

    x0.domain(data.map(function(d) { return d.deviceType; }));
    x1.domain(deviceClass).rangeRoundBands([0, x0.rangeBand()]);
    y.domain([0, d3.max(data, function(d) { return d3.max(d.whenPurchased, function(d) { return d.value; }); })]);

the rect appending and positioning:

    device.selectAll(""rect"")
        .data(function(d) { return d.whenPurchased; })
      .enter().append(""rect"")
        .attr(""width"", x1.rangeBand())
        .attr(""x"", function(d) { return x1(d.device); })
        .attr(""y"", function(d) { return y(d.value); })
        .attr(""height"", function(d) { return height - y(d.value); })
        .style(""fill"", function(d) { return color(d.device); });

I can't seem to get the refactoring right and I think that is because I don't exactly get how domain works for x0 and basically not getting that right has a waterfall effect of everything else not working.

I put the full example here: [JSFIDDLE][1]

"3331140","refactoring similar code targeted at all view controllers's navigation bar","0","I'm trying to find the best way to refactor this. Right now, each of the view controllers (about 20 of them) have a function that initializes the content of the toolbar / navigation bar like so ie,

-(void)toolbarInit 

and on each of the controller's viewDidLoad, you will see that the function is being called ie, [self toolbarInit];

Basically what that toolbarInit does is to put a loginButton on the navigation bar's rightBarButtonItem.

Should I:

a. put the toolbar/nav bar setup in the app delegate ( is it possible to initialize each of the view controller's nav bar no matter how deep down the stack it is already?)

b. create a toolbarController or something and just put all the setup code/login code over there?

and calling it from controller like:

    order.add_line_items_to_order_from_cart(cart)

Does it make sense or not in terms of ""skinny controller / fat models"" pattern?

"40916594","refactor python script to a method, for integration with larger process","0","What I need to do is refactor a script, to turn it into a method that can be added to a larger process. 

**STEP A**

The point is- there's a data processing task that I'm working on- the first step is to create data of the following form: 


    3|Victoria|[51.503378, -0.139134]|2673
    52|Cubitt Town|[51.505199, -0.018848]|23
    5|United Kingdom|[54.75844, -2.69531]|459
    6|London|[51.50853, -0.12574]|346
    296|Bucharest|[44.43225, 26.10626]|9
    352|Vilich-Müldorf|[50.75024, 7.15283]|4
    48|Gut Scheibenhardt|[49.001249, 8.412378]|3
    314|Westerham|[48.0601, 11.62219]|9
    45|Honartsdeich|[53.557429, 9.987297]|34
    9779|Martinsried|[48.137418, 11.555737]|11
    343|Brussels|[50.85045, 4.34878]|27
    563|Russell Square|[51.519403, -0.133906]|20
    2|Germany|[51.5, 10.5]|20
    11|Farringdon|[51.51807, -0.10852]|154
    609|Fröttmaning|[48.16652, 11.59038]|3

**STEP B**

So then Step B will operate on the result of the above step (described by **PROCESS** below) and it will output data like so (the final data representation).

This means that **PROCESS** creates the data displayed in **STEP A**.


*The final data representation looks like this:*

    code: GB-ENG, jobs: 2673
    code: GB-ENG, jobs: 23
    code: GB-ENG, jobs: 459
    code: GB-ENG, jobs: 346
    code: RO-B, jobs: 9
    code: DE-NW, jobs: 4
    code: DE-BW, jobs: 3
    code: DE-BY, jobs: 9
    code: DE-HH, jobs: 34
    code: DE-BY, jobs: 11
    code: BE-BRU, jobs: 27
    code: GB-ENG, jobs: 20
    code: DE-TH, jobs: 20
    code: GB-ENG, jobs: 154
    code: DE-BY, jobs: 3


The script which performs that magic (creates the final output data displayed above) looks in this way: 

    import json
    import requests
    from collections import defaultdict
    from pprint import pprint

    def hasNumbers(inputString):
        return any(char.isdigit() for char in inputString)

    # open up the output of 'data-processing.py'
    with open('job-numbers-by-location.txt') as data_file:

        # print the output to a file
        with open('phase_ii_output.txt', 'w') as output_file_:
            for line in data_file:
                identifier, name, coords, number_of_jobs = line.split(""|"")
                coords = coords[1:-1]
                lat, lng = coords.split("","")
                # print(""lat: "" + lat, ""lng: "" + lng)
                response = requests.get(""http://api.geonames.org/countrySubdivisionJSON?lat=""+lat+""&lng=""+lng+""&username=s.matthew.english"").json()


                codes = response.get('codes', [])
                for code in codes:
                    if code.get('type') == 'ISO3166-2':
                        country_code = '{}-{}'.format(response.get('countryCode', 'UNKNOWN'), code.get('code', 'UNKNOWN'))
                        if not hasNumbers( country_code ):
                            # print(""code: "" + country_code + "", jobs: "" + number_of_jobs)
                            output_file_.write(""code: "" + country_code + "", jobs: "" + number_of_jobs)
        output_file_.close()


But what I need to do is make it into a method, so I can fuse it into this process: 

**PROCESS**

    import json
    from collections import defaultdict
    from pprint import pprint


    def process_locations_data(data):
        # processes the 'data' block
        locations = defaultdict(int)
        for item in data['data']:
            location = item['relationships']['location']['data']['id']
            locations[location] += 1
        return locations


    def process_locations_included(data):
        # processes the 'included' block
        return_list = []
        for record in data['included']:
            id = record.get('id', None)
            name = record.get('attributes', {}).get('name', None)
            coord = record.get('attributes', {}).get('coord', None)
            return_list.append((id, name, coord))
        return return_list    # return list of tuples




    # load the data from file once
    with open('data-science.txt') as data_file:
        data = json.load(data_file)


    # use the two functions on same data
    locations = process_locations_data(data)
    records = process_locations_included(data)


    # output list to collect lines
    output = []


    # combine the data for printing
    for record in records:
        id, name, coord = record
        references = locations[id]   # lookup the references in the dict
        line = str(id) + ""|"" + str(name) + ""|"" + str(coord) + ""|"" + str(references) + ""\n""
        if line not in output:
            output.append(line)


    # print the output to a file
    with open('job-numbers-by-location.txt', 'w') as file_:
        for l in output:
            if not (""None"") in l:
                if not (""[0, 0]"") in l:
                    file_.write(l)
    file_.close()



but the thing is- I keep failing in my efforts to make that script into a method within there. 

How to refactorize that script into an independent method that could be included into the process?

-i can make it work using 11 times a different method or with a case operator. But i am trying to refactor.  

-I'd love to put my ""for"" loop in a method and call it but can't figure out how. if i define a method and call it all the image vanish and no file get uploaded (locally or on the S3 bucket)

Thanks a lot for reading me .

"15534746","refactoring an expensive query in rails","0","I been all day trying to refactor my queries. It was taking several minutes for a table with 20 records to load. At first, I blamed the query in this stackoverflow post:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15442194/rails-using-rails-cache-gives-error

However, after doing some testing, I realized that query was loading very fast, and was not the culprit.

Then I blamed it on kaminari, as I thought that kaminari was populating thousands of records into ruby objects, as I explained in this post:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15528861/rails-and-kaminari

But that was wrong too. Kaminari was only loading 20 records at a time (I used the logger to check how many reports where being loaded and it showed 20).

So finally I think I found the real culprit. It is another query that occurs during the pagination of that page. I realized that this query is taking more than 20 seconds to load each time it is run:



    def virtual_fence_duration
        inside_fence_time = nil
        outside_fence_time = nil
        
        outside_fence_time = self.time
        
        previous_reports = Report.where{(time    <  my{self.time}) &
                                       (unit_id == my{self.unit_id})}.order('time desc')
        
        previous_reports.each do |report|
          alerts = report.alerts.collect { |a| a.code_name }
          if alerts.include? ""Inside virtual fence""
            inside_fence_time = report.time
            break
          end
        end
        
        if inside_fence_time && outside_fence_time
          ""Virtual Fence Elapsed Time: #{(((outside_fence_time - inside_fence_time).to_i).to_f/60.0).ceil} minutes"" 
        else
          """"
        end    
      end

Basically, this method gets called when there is an alert that is  ""outside virtual fence"". I store the time. And then I query all the reports previous to it (reports has_many alerts). Then I use the each iterator of ruby to go through every single report and then the alerts associated with those reports to find the alert that is ""inside virtual fence"". Then I store the time of that report and take the difference between the two times. This logic seems to be taking forever if there are  alot of reports between the two durations. Is there a more efficient way to do this in sql (mysql) or ruby?

so an array with 2 arrays in it wich contains other arrays for each pizza where the ""pizzerianaam"" value matches.

I edited the classpath of the other projects to include the common source folder as a linked source.

This works fine, but I'm having troubles when I refactor a class or method name in the common project. The refactoring is not propagated to the non-common classes in the other projects that makes use of the refactored class or method, resulting in compile errors that a certain class or method is not found.

The only way I can deal with this is either: 

 1. Don't change the name of anything
 2. Manually change the name in all projects after refactoring

"7819170","refactor a dal with hibernate,dao,services and unit of work : how to put all togheter","0","i'm refactoring a jsf web application dal which uses hibernate and the dao pattern, at the moment each data acces class handles its own session and transaction into each method (a session per operation antipattern is it? )
for example :

	public void saveEntity(ModelEntity entity) throws Exception {
		String entityName = getCleanClassName(entity.getClass());
		Session session = null;
		Transaction tx = null;
		try {
			session = SessionFactoryUtil.getInstance().openSession();
			tx = session.beginTransaction();
			session.saveOrUpdate(entity);
			session.flush();
			tx.commit();
		} catch (Exception ex) {
			tx.rollback();
                        ...
			throw new Exception(msg, ex);
		} finally {
			session.close();
		}
	}


Above classes can be used directly into backing bean actions or through some business logic classes methods (for example create new detached object, set some values and store them trhough DAO objects). Now i've found that some businness logic classes methods need to be executed atomically, for example :

                           //inside some backing bean actionlistener
			DocumentoManager dm = new DocumentoManager();
			PraticaManager pm = new PraticaManager();
			Documento newDoc = new Documento();
			newDoc.setDataArrivo(new java.util.Date			                  newDoc.setNote(""..."");
			Allegato newAll = new Allegato();
			newAll.setTitolo(newDoc.getNote());
                           //businness logic methods that should be executed atomically
			dm.creaDocumentoDaAllegato(newDoc,newAll,
				event.getFile().getContents(),
				event.getFile().getFileName(),
				"""");
			pm.collegaDocumento(pratica, newDoc);



Finally i've a sessionFactoryUtil class which manages hibernate session (getcurrentSession, openSession, etc ... ).

How can i refactor the above architecture? i was thinking to do the following:

 1. remove the transaction from the DAO objects : i can't put
    transactions management into bl classes (xxxManager) , so should i
    use a class that just create,commit or rollback the transaction ,
    encapsulating the sessionFactoryUtil, and to be used inside backing
    beans (say jta userTransaction) ? 
 2. If someone try to use directly the DAO object how do i set the session ? Accessing sessionFactoryUtil into DAOs methods ?
 3. Is it safe to call getCurrentSession inside DAOs?
 4. if i create a class to handle businness logic transactions, how can i be sure it's thread safe ?

I think sessionFactoryUtil is thread safe since it's been written following the pattern suggested on hibernate guide :



	private SessionFactoryUtil() {
	}

	static {
		// Annotation and XML
		// sessionFactory = new
		// AnnotationConfiguration().configure().buildSessionFactory();
		// XML only
		try {
			sessionFactory = new Configuration().configure().buildSessionFactory();
		} catch (Exception e) {
                      ...
		}
		
	}

	public static SessionFactory getInstance() {
		try{
			return sessionFactory;
		} catch (Exception ex)
		{
			return null;
		}
	}
